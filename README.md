# checkers
Determines the best score possible for a game of checkers with player1 only having 1 pawn left and player2 having multiple pawns. 
A pawn can only move forward and diagonaly, jumping over player2's pawns as long as the space beyond that pawn is empty. 

The board is generated automatically. 

Use of Turtle to generate the board, showing the initial position of all the pawns and the route player1's pawn can take.
